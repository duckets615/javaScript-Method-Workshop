# javaScript-Method-Workshop


### What is this?
Theres hardly anything javaScript cannot do. It can be implemented for a basic menial task like hamburger menus or used to build out entire, high level single page applications. Howerver, For a language to be this broad in its application, it must use hundreds of methods, tips, and tricks. So many that even the most advanced jS user cannot know them all. This repo is dedicated to familiarizing jS users with the many tools jS provides.

### Who should use this?

Any jS user looking to broaden their understaning of can make use of this repo but that target group is beginners to intermediate coders.

### How do I use this?

To start, fork this repo to your repositories. This repo is broken up by object. Every object (array, string, ect.) will have  subfolders of all the methods and properties available to it. Each method will have a problem set which consist of a brief description of the method and a number of code challenges to become familiar with using them. These challenges are simple and repetitive for the purpose of building muscle memory so that when your writing your own code, recognizing the best method to use and how to implement in different situations will come as naturally as breathing. A solution file with the answers will also be included.

### What if I find an error or know of a better solution?

Tell me! This is about inmproving our jS skills. All comments and pull request are welcome.
